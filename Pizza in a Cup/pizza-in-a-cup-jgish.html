        <ul class="Items">
        <li>1 cannister of pizza dough per 4 servings</li>
        <li>1 package of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 package of pepperoni and/or other toppings as desired</li>
        <li>1 can of marinara sauce (Yes, it has to be in a can. See <a href="#Things To Say">"Movie Quotes to Say While You're Cooking."</a>)</li>

        <ol class="Items">
        <li>Open the cannister of dough and cut it into quarters, keeping each piece cylinder-shaped.</li>
        <li>Cut each quarter into thirds, still keeping each piece cylinder-shaped.</li>
        <li>Spray a mug and place a piece of dough in its bottom, spreading the dough as needed to fill the bottom of the mug.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce on top of the inserted dough.</li>
        <li>Scatter shredded mozzarella over the sauce and sprinkle oregano and basil over the cheese to taste.</li>
        <li>Place pepperoni and/or other toppings on cheese and add another, thinner layer of cheese.</li>
        <li>Depending on the size of your mug, repeat layers of dough, sauce, cheese with oregano and basil, toppings and more cheese two more times, except do not add more cheese after the last layer of toppings. Stop filling the mug when the layers are one quarter inch from the top.</li>
        <li>Repeat for each remaing mug.</li>
        <li>Place filled mugs on a baking sheet to collect any overflow. Place baking sheet in oven.</li>
        <li>Turn on oven and set temperature for 425&#176; F. Bake for 30 minutes (preheat time included) or until cheese is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove and let cool for 10 minutes. Serve with a spoon or spork.</li>
